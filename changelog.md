* **(.0)**  NEW FEATURE:	'FABLE' - [Fully Automatic Black Listing Engine](https://clk.shldscrty.com/wpsf27).

Simply put, FABLE will automatically block all malicious traffic by IP, based on their activity. This Security Plugin will track malicious behaviour
and count all transgressions that visitors make against the site.  Once a particular visitor exceeds the specified number transgressions, FABLE
will outright block any access they have to your WordPress site.

What makes the FABLE system better?

* Hands Free - Automatic. No more need for maintaining manual black lists.
* Loads first before other plugins.
* Automatic pruning. Based on expiration time you specify, older IP address will be removed.
* Increased Performance. With automatic pruning, IP look-up tables remain small and concise so page load times for legitimate visitors is minimally affected.
* Adaptive. It wont just block based on 1 misdemeanour - instead you may allow any given visitor grace to legitimately get things wrong (like login passwords).
* Intelligent. With an fully integrated plugin such as this, it uses login failure attempts, spam comment attempts, login brute force attempts to capture malicious visitors.

Which actions will trigger an ABLE transgression?

* Attempt to login with an invalid username/password combination
* Any attempt to login while the login cooldown system is in-effect
* Any login attempt that trips the GASP Login protection system
* Any login attempt with a username that doesn't exist
* Any attempt to access /wp-admin/, /login/, or wp-login.php while the Rename WP Login setting is active
* Any comment that gets labelled as SPAM by the plugin
* Failed attempt to authenticate with the plugin's Admin Access Protection module
* Any trigger of a Firewall block rule
