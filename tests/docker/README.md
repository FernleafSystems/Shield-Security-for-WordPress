# Docker Testing Infrastructure for Shield Security

**Status**: **Production Ready** âœ… - Fully implemented and validated with GitHub Actions Run ID 16694657226 showing all tests passing.

This directory contains Docker configuration for running Shield Security tests in containerized environments with support for both source and package testing.

## Philosophy: Unified Test Runner

Following WordPress plugin best practices (Yoast, EDD, WooCommerce), we use a unified test runner (`bin/run-tests.ps1`) that supports both native and Docker testing with environment detection in bootstrap files. This maintains 100% backward compatibility while adding Docker support.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Docker Desktop installed and running
- Docker Compose (included with Docker Desktop)
- 4GB+ RAM allocated to Docker

### Source Testing (Default)

Test against current source code - unified runner approach:

```bash
# Using unified test runner (recommended)
.\bin\run-tests.ps1 all -Docker                    # All tests
.\bin\run-tests.ps1 unit -Docker                   # Unit tests only
.\bin\run-tests.ps1 integration -Docker            # Integration tests only

# Using Composer commands
composer docker:test                           # All tests
composer docker:test:unit                      # Unit tests only
composer docker:test:integration               # Integration tests only
```

### Package Testing

Test against built, production-ready plugin package (fully implemented and validated):

```bash
# Using unified test runner (builds package automatically)
.\bin\run-tests.ps1 all -Docker -Package           # All tests against package
.\bin\run-tests.ps1 unit -Docker -Package          # Unit tests against package

# Using Composer commands
composer docker:test:package                   # All tests against package
```

**Package Testing Implementation:**
- Uses `docker-compose.package.yml` override file for package-specific configuration
- `PLUGIN_SOURCE` and `SHIELD_PACKAGE_PATH` environment variables control package testing mode
- Package is automatically built and mounted into the test container
- Validated in production with GitHub Actions Run ID 16694657226

## Unified Test Runner

### PowerShell: `bin/run-tests.ps1`

The unified test runner supports both native and Docker testing:

```powershell
# Native testing (default)
.\bin\run-tests.ps1 all                            # All tests
.\bin\run-tests.ps1 unit                           # Unit tests only  
.\bin\run-tests.ps1 integration                    # Integration tests only

# Docker testing (add -Docker flag)
.\bin\run-tests.ps1 all -Docker                    # All tests in Docker
.\bin\run-tests.ps1 unit -Docker                   # Unit tests in Docker
.\bin\run-tests.ps1 integration -Docker            # Integration tests in Docker

# Package testing (add -Package flag)
.\bin\run-tests.ps1 all -Docker -Package           # Test built package
.\bin\run-tests.ps1 unit -Docker -Package          # Unit tests on package

# Custom versions
.\bin\run-tests.ps1 all -Docker -PhpVersion 8.1 -WpVersion 6.3
```

## Architecture

### Services
- **wordpress**: WordPress with PHP and test dependencies
- **mysql**: MySQL 8.0 database server  
- **test-runner**: Dedicated container for running tests

### Key Files
- `Dockerfile`: Builds test environment with PHPUnit, Composer, and WordPress test suite
- `docker-compose.yml`: Multi-container environment with flexible volume mapping
- `docker-compose.package.yml`: Override configuration for package testing
- `.env.example`: Available customization options (all optional)
- `../../bin/run-tests.ps1`: Unified test runner with Docker support and package building

### Environment Detection

Bootstrap files automatically detect the testing environment:

1. **Package testing**: When `SHIELD_PACKAGE_PATH` environment variable is set
2. **Docker testing**: When `/var/www/html/wp-content/plugins/wp-simple-firewall` directory exists  
3. **Source testing**: Default mode using current repository directory

This follows the same pattern as Yoast WordPress SEO, Easy Digital Downloads, and WooCommerce. The unified test runner (`bin/run-tests.ps1`) handles both native and Docker environments seamlessly.

## Configuration Options

### Default Settings

Works immediately without any configuration:
- PHP 8.2
- WordPress 6.4  
- MySQL 8.0
- Source code testing

### Environment Variables

All variables have defaults - `.env` file is completely optional:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `PHP_VERSION` | 8.2 | PHP version |
| `WP_VERSION` | 6.4 | WordPress version |
| `MYSQL_VERSION` | 8.0 | MySQL version |
| `MYSQL_DATABASE` | wordpress_test | Database name |
| `MYSQL_USER` | wordpress | Database user |
| `MYSQL_PASSWORD` | wordpress | Database password |
| `PLUGIN_SOURCE` | `../../` | Plugin source directory (for volume mounting) |
| `SHIELD_PACKAGE_PATH` | (empty) | Set to enable package testing mode |

### Package Testing Configuration

Package testing is fully implemented and automatically handled by the test runner scripts:

**Automatic Configuration (Recommended):**
```bash
# Package testing is automatically configured when using -Package flag
.\bin\run-tests.ps1 all -Docker -Package
```

**Manual Configuration (Advanced):**
```bash
# Create .env for manual package testing
cat > tests/docker/.env << EOF
PLUGIN_SOURCE=/tmp/my-package-dir
SHIELD_PACKAGE_PATH=/var/www/html/wp-content/plugins/wp-simple-firewall
EOF
```

**Key Environment Variables for Package Testing:**
- `PLUGIN_SOURCE`: Source directory containing the built package
- `SHIELD_PACKAGE_PATH`: Target path in container where package is mounted
- Uses `docker-compose.package.yml` override file for package-specific volume mappings

## Manual Docker Commands

For advanced usage or debugging:

```bash
# Start containers manually (source testing)
docker-compose -f tests/docker/docker-compose.yml up -d

# Start containers with package testing override
docker-compose -f tests/docker/docker-compose.yml -f tests/docker/docker-compose.package.yml up -d

# Stop containers
docker-compose -f tests/docker/docker-compose.yml down

# View logs
docker-compose -f tests/docker/docker-compose.yml logs -f

# Run commands in container
docker-compose -f tests/docker/docker-compose.yml exec test-runner bash

# Run specific test file
docker-compose -f tests/docker/docker-compose.yml exec test-runner composer test:unit -- tests/Unit/PluginJsonSchemaTest.php

# Rebuild images
docker-compose -f tests/docker/docker-compose.yml build --no-cache

# Remove everything (including volumes)
docker-compose -f tests/docker/docker-compose.yml down -v
```

## Composer Integration

The project's `composer.json` includes Docker testing commands that use the unified test runner:

```bash
# Source testing
composer docker:test                    # All tests in Docker
composer docker:test:unit               # Unit tests in Docker
composer docker:test:integration        # Integration tests in Docker

# Package testing (builds package automatically)
composer docker:test:package            # Build package and run all tests in Docker
```

All commands use `bin/run-tests.ps1` internally with appropriate flags.

## Troubleshooting

### Test Runner Script Issues
```bash
# Make scripts executable (Linux/Mac)
chmod +x tests/docker/run-tests.sh

# Check script permissions
ls -la tests/docker/run-tests.*
```

### Database Connection Issues
```bash
# Check service health
docker-compose -f tests/docker/docker-compose.yml ps

# View MySQL logs
docker-compose -f tests/docker/docker-compose.yml logs mysql

# Restart with fresh database
docker-compose -f tests/docker/docker-compose.yml down -v
docker-compose -f tests/docker/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

### Package Build Issues
```bash
# Test package building manually
./bin/build-package.sh /tmp/test-package

# Check package structure
ls -la /tmp/test-package/
ls -la /tmp/test-package/src/lib/vendor_prefixed/
```

### Permission Issues (Linux/Mac)
```bash
# Fix ownership
sudo chown -R $(whoami):$(whoami) .

# Check Docker group membership
groups $USER
```

### Windows-Specific Issues
- Ensure Docker Desktop uses WSL2 backend
- Allocate 4GB+ RAM in Docker Desktop settings
- Use PowerShell or Git Bash, not Command Prompt
- Ensure file sharing is enabled for the project directory

## Development Workflow

### Typical Development Cycle
```powershell
# 1. Make code changes
# 2. Test changes with source testing
.\bin\run-tests.ps1 unit -Docker

# 3. Test full integration
.\bin\run-tests.ps1 integration -Docker

# 4. Before release: test packaged plugin
.\bin\run-tests.ps1 all -Docker -Package
```

### CI/CD Integration

The Docker infrastructure is designed to work in CI/CD environments:
- No interactive prompts
- Proper exit codes
- Comprehensive error reporting
- Automatic cleanup

#### GitHub Actions Docker Workflow

Shield Security includes a **production-ready GitHub Actions Docker Tests workflow** following evidence-based patterns:

**Status**: **Production Ready** âœ… - Validated with GitHub Actions Run ID 16694657226 showing all tests passing

**Accessing the Workflow:**
1. Navigate to **Actions** tab in GitHub repository
2. Select **"Docker Tests"** workflow  
3. Click **"Run workflow"** and configure:
   - PHP Version: 7.4, 8.0, 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, or 8.4
   - WordPress Version: Any valid WordPress version
   - Test Package: Option to test production build

**Evidence-Based Implementation:**
- **Build Dependencies**: Node.js, npm, and asset building handled by GitHub Actions workflow
- **Manual Trigger Only**: Based on Easy Digital Downloads pattern
- **Simple Architecture**: MariaDB 10.2 + test-runner (following EDD's docker-compose-phpunit.yml)
- **Standard Integration**: Uses existing bin/install-wp-tests.sh and run-tests-docker.sh
- **Proven Patterns**: All build steps copied from working `minimal.yml` evidence

**Production Validation Completed:**
- âœ… **GitHub Actions Run ID 16694657226**: All tests passing in production
- âœ… **Build dependencies**: Node.js, npm, and asset building handled by GitHub Actions workflow
- âœ… **Package testing**: `docker-compose.package.yml` override file working correctly
- âœ… **Environment variables**: `PLUGIN_SOURCE` and `SHIELD_PACKAGE_PATH` properly configured
- âœ… **Script permissions**: Verified (755) and line endings confirmed (Unix LF)
- âœ… **Docker infrastructure**: Images build successfully with all dependencies
- âœ… **Test execution**: Both source and package testing modes validated

**Why Manual-Only Trigger:**
Research of established WordPress plugins (Yoast SEO, Easy Digital Downloads, WooCommerce) revealed that most use native GitHub Actions for regular CI/CD, with Docker reserved for optional testing scenarios to avoid overhead.

**Workflow Features:**
- **Full Build Pipeline**: Includes Node.js setup, npm dependencies, and asset building
- **Manual Trigger**: workflow_dispatch prevents CI/CD overhead while allowing on-demand testing
- **Matrix Testing**: Configurable PHP (7.4-8.4) and WordPress versions
- **Package Testing**: Optional production build testing with `docker-compose.package.yml`
- **Proven Architecture**: MariaDB 10.2 + test-runner following established WordPress plugin patterns
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Environment cleanup after test execution
- **Production Validated**: GitHub Actions Run ID 16694657226 confirms all functionality working
- **SKIP_DB_CREATE**: Follows WordPress Docker testing patterns to avoid interactive prompts

## Maintenance

### Keeping Images Updated
```bash
# Update base images
docker-compose -f tests/docker/docker-compose.yml pull
docker-compose -f tests/docker/docker-compose.yml build --no-cache

# Clean up old images
docker system prune -f
```

### Performance Optimization
```bash
# Use Docker BuildKit for faster builds
export DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1
docker-compose -f tests/docker/docker-compose.yml build --no-cache

# Allocate more resources in Docker Desktop settings:
# - Memory: 4GB+ recommended
# - CPUs: 2+ recommended  
# - Disk space: 20GB+ recommended
```
