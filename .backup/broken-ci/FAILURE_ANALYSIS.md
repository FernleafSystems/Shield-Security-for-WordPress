# Broken CI/CD System Analysis

## What Was Wrong

### 1. Assumption-Based Implementation
- Used `vendor/bin/phpunit` assuming it would work (it's a shell script requiring `/usr/bin/env php`)
- Used `--report=github` for PHPCS without checking if format exists
- Assumed SVN was installed on GitHub runners
- Assumed paths without verification

### 2. Wrong PHPUnit Execution
**Problem**: Used `vendor/bin/phpunit` which is shell script wrapper
**Evidence**: Yoast uses `@php ./vendor/phpunit/phpunit/phpunit` in composer.json
**Error**: "Cannot open file ./tests/Unit/bootstrap.php" - shell script couldn't find PHP

### 3. Wrong PHPCS Report Format  
**Problem**: Used `--report=github` which doesn't exist in PHPCS 3.13.2
**Evidence**: PHPCS help shows available formats: "full", "xml", "checkstyle", "csv", "json", "junit", "emacs", "source", "summary", "diff", "svnblame", "gitblame", "hgblame", "notifysend", "performance"
**Error**: "Class file for report 'github' not found"

### 4. Missing System Dependencies
**Problem**: Integration tests failed because SVN not installed
**Evidence**: Yoast explicitly installs with `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y subversion`
**Error**: "svn: command not found"

### 5. Complex Pipeline Before Proving Basics
- Built full pipeline with multiple jobs before verifying simple checkout/build works
- Added debugging instead of fixing root cause approach
- Tried to fix symptoms instead of understanding the system

## Lessons Learned

1. **Evidence-Based Implementation**: Every component must be backed by documentation or working examples
2. **Minimal First**: Prove basic mechanics work before adding complexity
3. **No Assumptions**: If unsure, research the exact working pattern
4. **Study Successful Examples**: Yoast/EDD patterns are proven and should be followed exactly

## Files Backed Up
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - The broken pipeline
- `phpunit-unit.xml` - PHPUnit configuration  
- `phpunit-integration.xml` - Integration test configuration

## Next Steps
1. Start with minimal working CI that does almost nothing
2. Prove checkout + build + trivial test works
3. Add features incrementally using only proven patterns
