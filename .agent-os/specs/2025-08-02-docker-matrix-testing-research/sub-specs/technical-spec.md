## Critical Infrastructure Resolution Details

### Interactive Input Fixes (ROOT CAUSE RESOLUTION)

**Problem Identification**: CI workflows were hanging indefinitely due to interactive input prompts waiting for user input in non-interactive environments.

**Root Causes Identified**:
1. **Docker TTY Allocation**: `docker compose run` attempting to allocate pseudo-TTY in CI environment
2. **MySQL Password Prompts**: MySQL client prompting for password when `DB_PASS` was empty string

**Technical Solutions Applied**:

#### Docker TTY Fix
```yaml
# Before (caused hanging)
- run: docker compose run --rm app composer test

# After (fixed with -T flag)
- run: docker compose run -T --rm app composer test
```
**Explanation**: The `-T` flag disables pseudo-TTY allocation, preventing Docker from waiting for terminal input.

#### MySQL Password Prompt Fix
```bash
# Before (caused interactive prompt)
mysql -h"$DB_HOST" -P"$DB_PORT" -u"$DB_USER" --password="$DB_PASS"

# After (conditional password syntax)
mysql -h"$DB_HOST" -P"$DB_PORT" -u"$DB_USER" ${DB_PASS:+--password="$DB_PASS"}
```
**Explanation**: `${DB_PASS:+--password="$DB_PASS"}` only includes the password parameter if `DB_PASS` is non-empty, preventing interactive prompts.

**Files Updated**:
- `.github/workflows/docker-tests.yml`: Added `-T` flag to Docker compose commands
- `bin/run-tests-docker.sh`: Updated MySQL connection syntax
- `bin/install-wp-tests.sh`: Updated MySQL connection syntax

**Validation**: Simplified matrix now runs without hanging, confirming the fixes resolve the infrastructure blocking issues.

## Implementation Specifics
