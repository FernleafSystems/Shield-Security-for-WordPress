    {
      "version": "6.8.2",
      "download": "https://downloads.wordpress.org/...",
      "packages": {...}
    }
  ]
}

# Implementation Strategy

- Caches results for workflow duration
```

### Optimization Pattern Analysis
```yaml
# Common Patterns Identified
Caching Strategies:
â”œâ”€â”€ Composer Dependencies: ~/.composer/cache

Parallel Execution:
â”œâ”€â”€ Matrix Strategy: PHP version matrices
â”œâ”€â”€ Resource Limits: max-parallel configurations
â”œâ”€â”€ Fail-Fast: Early termination on failures
â””â”€â”€ Conditional Testing: Different matrices for PRs vs main
```
