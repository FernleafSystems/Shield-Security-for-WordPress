# Spec Summary (Lite)

Research tracking for Docker matrix testing implementation - currently simplified to single PHP/WordPress version due to infrastructure issues. Analysis of major WordPress plugins (WooCommerce, Yoast SEO, EDD) completed, but full matrix implementation temporarily disabled pending infrastructure stability.

**Current State**: Matrix testing simplified to PHP 7.4 + latest WordPress only. Full matrix (PHP 7.4-8.4, multiple WordPress versions) commented out but ready for re-enablement once Docker infrastructure is stabilized.

**Critical Infrastructure Fixes Applied**:
- BOM removal from shell scripts
- Path resolution fixes for Docker environments  
- Environment variable configuration corrections
- Working simplified matrix demonstrates infrastructure viability
