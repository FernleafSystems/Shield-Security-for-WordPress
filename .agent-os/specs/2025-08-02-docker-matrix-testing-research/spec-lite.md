# Spec Summary (Lite)

Research tracking for Docker matrix testing implementation - **RESOLVED**. Critical interactive input issues that caused CI hanging have been identified and fixed. Analysis of major WordPress plugins (WooCommerce, Yoast SEO, EDD) completed, infrastructure now stable for matrix expansion.

**Current State**: Matrix testing simplified to PHP 7.4 + latest WordPress only. Full matrix (PHP 7.4-8.4, multiple WordPress versions) commented out but **ready for immediate re-enablement** - infrastructure blocking issues resolved.

**Critical Infrastructure Fixes Applied** (RESOLVED HANGING ISSUES):
- BOM removal from shell scripts
- Path resolution fixes for Docker environments  
- Environment variable configuration corrections
- **Interactive Input Fixes (ROOT CAUSE)**:
  - Docker TTY allocation fix: `-T` flag prevents pseudo-TTY allocation in CI
  - MySQL password prompt fix: Conditional syntax prevents interactive prompts
  - **Key Finding**: Interactive input prompts (not just BOM) were the true cause of hanging
- Working simplified matrix demonstrates infrastructure is now stable
