  - [x] GitHub Actions native approach preferred
  - [x] Matrix testing across PHP versions standard
  - [x] Heavy dependency caching usage
  - [x] WordPress version testing varies by plugin

- [x] **Key Insights Documented**:
  - [x] WooCommerce: wp-env, massive parallel execution, PNPM
  - [x] Yoast SEO: PHP Matrix 7.4-8.3, WordPress latest/trunk, weekly cache busting
  - [x] WordPress API: Reliable real-time version information

- [x] **Optimization Techniques Identified**:
  - [x] Dependency caching (Composer, npm)
  - [x] Parallel execution patterns
  - [x] Fail-fast strategies
  - [x] Selective testing approaches
  - [x] Cancel previous workflow runs

### Implementation Status
- [x] **WordPress version detection integrated** into run-tests.ps1
- [x] **Dynamic version detection added** to GitHub workflow
- [x] **Matrix strategy implemented** with conditional logic
- [ ] **Docker build optimization** - ⚠️ Pending implementation
