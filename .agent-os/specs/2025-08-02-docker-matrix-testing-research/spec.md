## WordPress Version Detection Research

### API Endpoints Analysis

#### Version Check API
- **Endpoint**: `https://api.wordpress.org/core/version-check/1.7/`
- **Purpose**: Get latest WordPress version
- **Response Format**: JSON with version info and download links
- **Research Tasks**:
  - [x] Test API reliability - Working perfectly
  - [x] Parse response structure - Array of offers with version info
  - [x] Identify version formats - Semantic versioning (e.g., 6.8.2)
  - [x] Check update frequency - Real-time, always current

**API Response Structure**:
```json
{
  "offers": [
    {
      "version": "6.8.2",  // Latest version
      "download": "https://downloads.wordpress.org/...",
      "packages": {...}
    },
    // Previous versions in descending order
  ]
}
```

#### Version Detection Implementation
- **Script Created**: `bin/get-wp-versions.ps1`
- **Functionality**: 
  - Fetches latest WordPress version
  - Determines previous major version
  - Outputs for GitHub Actions integration
- **Current Results**:
  - Latest: 6.8.2
  - Previous Major: 6.7.2

### Version Detection Strategy
- [x] Design algorithm to extract latest and previous major - PowerShell script created
- [x] Plan caching mechanism - Can use GitHub Actions cache with TTL
- [x] Create fallback strategy - Script includes fallback logic
- [x] Consider update frequency - API is real-time, cache for workflow duration

3. How is Docker used in matrix testing (if at all)?
4. What are common caching strategies?
5. How do they handle flaky tests in matrix?

### Architecture Questions
1. GitHub Actions matrix vs custom orchestration?

## Research Methodology

### Step 1: Repository Analysis
1. Clone each repository
2. Analyze workflow files
3. Document patterns
4. Extract metrics where available

### Step 2: Pattern Identification
1. Common approaches across plugins
2. Unique optimizations

## Findings Summary

### Common Patterns
1. **No Docker in Major Plugins**: Neither WooCommerce nor Yoast SEO use Docker for testing
2. **GitHub Actions Native**: Both use GitHub-hosted runners with services
3. **Matrix Testing**: Both implement PHP version matrix testing
4. **WordPress Version Testing**: Yoast tests multiple WP versions (latest, trunk, specific)
5. **Caching**: Heavy use of dependency caching (Composer, npm)

### Key Insights
1. **WooCommerce**:
   - Uses wp-env for WordPress environments
   - Massive parallel execution (max-parallel: 30)
   - PNPM for efficient dependency management
   - 20 min timeout for E2E, 10 min for unit tests

2. **Yoast SEO**:
   - PHP Matrix: 7.4, 8.0, 8.1, 8.2, 8.3
   - WordPress: Tests against 6.7, latest, and trunk
   - Weekly cache busting strategy
   - Cancel previous workflow runs

3. **WordPress API**:
   - Reliable real-time version information
   - Easy to parse for latest and previous versions
   - Can be integrated into existing scripts

### Optimization Techniques
1. **Dependency Caching**: Cache Composer and npm dependencies
2. **Parallel Execution**: Run matrix jobs in parallel
3. **Fail-Fast**: Stop on first failure to save resources
4. **Selective Testing**: Different matrix for PRs vs main branches
5. **Cancel Previous**: Cancel outdated workflow runs

### Recommended Approach
1. **Use Native GitHub Actions Matrix**: Simpler than Docker-based matrix
2. **Dynamic WordPress Versions**: Detect latest and previous major
3. **Full PHP Matrix**: Test 7.4, 8.0, 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4
4. **Conditional Matrix**: Full matrix on push, single job on manual trigger
5. **Aggressive Caching**: Cache Docker layers, dependencies, and assets

### Implementation Status
1. ✅ WordPress version detection integrated into run-tests.ps1
2. ✅ Dynamic version detection added to GitHub workflow
3. ✅ Matrix strategy implemented with conditional logic
4. ⏳ Docker build optimization pending
5. ⏳ Caching strategy implementation pending
