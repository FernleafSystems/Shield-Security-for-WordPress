Shield Security plugin has accumulated 11+ different PowerShell scripts for running tests, creating unnecessary complexity that diverges from industry standards. This specification reduces test commands from 11+ scripts to maximum 3 commands following industry standard patterns like WooCommerce and Yoast use.
