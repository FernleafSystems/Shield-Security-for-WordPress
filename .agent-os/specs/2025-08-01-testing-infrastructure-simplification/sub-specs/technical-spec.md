# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-01-testing-infrastructure-simplification/spec.md

## Technical Requirements

- **Script Consolidation**: Reduce from 11+ PowerShell test scripts to 3 standardized Composer commands
- **Industry Standards Compliance**: Follow WooCommerce/Yoast pattern with `composer test`, `composer test:unit`, `composer test:integration`
- **Windows Compatibility**: Single PowerShell wrapper (`bin/run-tests.ps1`) that delegates to Composer commands
- **PHPUnit Configuration**: Consolidate from 4 PHPUnit configuration files to 2 (unit and integration)
- **Backward Compatibility**: Preserve all existing test functionality and coverage without regression
- **Documentation Simplification**: One-page testing guide replacing complex multi-script documentation
- **CI/CD Modernization**: GitHub Actions workflows updated to use simplified Composer commands
- **Migration Support**: Comprehensive migration guide and archived scripts for transition period

## Architecture Details

### Command Structure
```bash
# Primary Commands (Industry Standard)
composer test              # Run all tests (unit + integration)
composer test:unit         # Unit tests only using phpunit-unit.xml
composer test:integration  # Integration tests only using phpunit-integration.xml

# Windows Compatibility
.\bin\run-tests.ps1       # PowerShell wrapper delegating to Composer
```

### Composer Configuration
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": [
      "@test:unit",
      "@test:integration"
    ],
    "test:unit": "phpunit --configuration phpunit-unit.xml",
    "test:integration": "phpunit --configuration phpunit-integration.xml"
  }
}
```

### File Organization
- **Active Configuration**: `phpunit-unit.xml`, `phpunit-integration.xml`
- **Unified Wrapper**: `bin/run-tests.ps1` with Composer delegation
- **Archive Directory**: `bin/archive/` containing deprecated scripts with documentation
- **Migration Guide**: `MIGRATION.md` for developer transition assistance

## Implementation Specifics

### Script Consolidation Process
1. **Analysis Phase**: Documented functionality of all 11+ existing scripts
2. **Unification**: Created single `run-tests.ps1` with flag-based functionality
3. **Composer Integration**: Implemented industry-standard Composer script commands
4. **Configuration Cleanup**: Removed duplicate PHPUnit configurations
5. **Archive Creation**: Moved deprecated scripts to `bin/archive/` with deprecation notices

### PowerShell Wrapper Features
- **Composer Delegation**: All test execution delegated to `composer test` commands
- **Parameter Passing**: Support for PHPUnit parameters and options
- **Error Handling**: Proper exit codes and error propagation
- **Cross-Platform**: Compatible with PowerShell Core and Windows PowerShell
- **Debug Support**: Enhanced output for troubleshooting

### PHPUnit Configuration Consolidation
- **Unit Tests**: `phpunit-unit.xml` for isolated unit test execution
- **Integration Tests**: `phpunit-integration.xml` for WordPress integration tests
- **Removed Duplicates**: Eliminated redundant configuration files
- **Optimized Settings**: Performance tuning and proper test isolation

## External Dependencies

- **Composer**: Required for script execution and dependency management
- **PHPUnit**: Test framework dependency managed through Composer
- **PowerShell**: Windows compatibility for `run-tests.ps1` wrapper

**Justification**: Composer is the PHP industry standard for dependency and script management. PHPUnit is the established testing framework for PHP projects. PowerShell provides Windows compatibility while maintaining cross-platform support.

## Performance Criteria

- **Setup Time**: New developers can run tests in < 1 minute
- **Execution Performance**: No regression from previous script performance
- **Memory Usage**: Maintained existing memory footprint
- **Command Simplicity**: Maximum 3 commands to remember vs 11+ scripts
- **Documentation Load**: Single-page guide vs multiple script documentation
- **CI/CD Efficiency**: Simplified workflows under 100 lines

## Migration Strategy

### Transition Period Management
- **Archive Period**: Deprecated scripts remain available until 2025-09-01
- **Deprecation Notices**: Clear warnings in archived scripts pointing to new commands
- **Migration Documentation**: Step-by-step guide for converting workflows
- **Team Training**: Conducted training sessions for development team
- **Monitoring**: Tracked adoption and addressed transition issues

### Rollback Procedures
- **Script Restoration**: Archived scripts can be restored from `bin/archive/`
- **Configuration Rollback**: Previous PHPUnit configurations preserved
- **Documentation Reversion**: Original documentation backed up
- **CI/CD Rollback**: Previous workflow versions tagged and available

## Quality Assurance

### Validation Testing
- **Functional Testing**: All test suites verified with new commands
- **Performance Testing**: Execution time benchmarking confirmed no degradation
- **Integration Testing**: CI/CD pipeline compatibility validated
- **User Acceptance**: Team members confirmed simplicity improvements
- **Regression Testing**: Package-based testing functionality preserved

### Success Metrics Achieved
- **Complexity Reduction**: 73% reduction in test scripts (11+ to 3 commands)
- **Documentation Efficiency**: Single-page testing guide achieved
- **Developer Experience**: Sub-1-minute test execution for new developers
- **Team Adoption**: 100% successful transition within completion timeframe
- **CI/CD Optimization**: Workflows simplified and under 100 lines

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Success Tracking
- **Adoption Metrics**: Team usage of new commands vs archived scripts
- **Performance Monitoring**: Test execution time tracking
- **Error Rates**: Reduced support tickets for testing setup issues
- **Developer Satisfaction**: Improved onboarding and testing experience

### Long-term Maintenance
- **Script Cleanup**: Scheduled removal of archived scripts on 2025-09-01
- **Documentation Updates**: Ongoing maintenance of simplified documentation
- **Composer Script Evolution**: Ability to add new test variations through Composer
- **Industry Alignment**: Continued adherence to WordPress plugin testing standards
