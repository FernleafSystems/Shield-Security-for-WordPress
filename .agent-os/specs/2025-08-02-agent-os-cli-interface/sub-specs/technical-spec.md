# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-02-agent-os-cli-interface/spec.md

## Technical Requirements

- PowerShell 5.1 or higher compatibility (standard on Windows 10+)
- Single-file architecture with modular function design
- Colorized output for better visibility using Write-Host color parameters
- Performance target: < 100ms for most operations
- Graceful error handling with helpful error messages
- Support for both absolute and relative spec name matching
- Pipeline-friendly output for integration with other tools

## Architecture Details

### Command Structure
```
aos <command> [options]
  status       - Show task index overview
  next         - Find next incomplete task
  show <spec>  - Display detailed spec status
  progress     - Show progress dashboard
  blocks       - List all blocking issues
  help         - Display command help
```

### Core Functions
- Task parsing engine to read and analyze tasks.md files
- Progress calculation with percentage and visual indicators
- Spec directory navigation with fuzzy matching
- Output formatting with consistent colorization
- Configuration system for user preferences

### Data Flow
1. Command parsing and validation
2. File system navigation to .agent-os structure
3. Content parsing (Markdown task format)
4. Data aggregation and calculation
5. Formatted output generation

## Implementation Specifics

### Task Detection Pattern
```powershell
# Regex patterns for task parsing
$taskPattern = "^[\s]*- \[(.)\]"  # Matches task checkboxes
$completePattern = "^[\s]*- \[x\]"  # Completed tasks
$blockingPattern = "⚠️"  # Blocking issues
```

### Directory Structure Discovery
- Automatic detection of .agent-os root
- Recursive search for spec directories with date prefix
- Validation of required files (spec.md, tasks.md, etc.)

### Output Formatting
- Consistent color scheme: Green (complete), Yellow (in-progress), Red (blocked)
- Progress bars using Unicode box characters
- Tabular data using Format-Table for alignment

## Performance Criteria

- Startup time: < 50ms
- Task index generation: < 100ms for 50 specs
- Individual spec analysis: < 20ms
- Memory usage: < 10MB for typical operation
- Support for projects with 100+ specifications
