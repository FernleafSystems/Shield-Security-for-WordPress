## Technical Implementation Details

### Docker Architecture
**Multi-Stage Build Structure**:
1. **Stage 1**: Base dependencies (Composer production)
2. **Stage 2**: Development dependencies  
3. **Stage 3**: WordPress test framework
4. **Stage 4**: Asset compilation
5. **Stage 5**: Final lean testing image

**Image Optimization Results**:
- Before: ~300-400MB single-stage images
- After: ~100-150MB multi-stage images (60-75% reduction)
- CI/CD Benefit: 3x faster pull times

### WordPress Version Detection System
**API Integration**:
- Primary: `https://api.wordpress.org/core/version-check/1.7/`
- Secondary: `https://api.wordpress.org/core/stable-check/1.0/`
- 5-Level Fallback: retry → secondary API → cache → repository → hardcoded
- Current Detection: WordPress 6.8.2 (latest), 6.7.3 (previous)

### Performance Results
**GitHub Actions Run #17036484124 Performance**:
- Detect WordPress Versions: 6 seconds
- Test PHP 7.4 / WP 6.7.3: 2m 40s (47% under target)
- Test PHP 7.4 / WP 6.8.2: 2m 7s (58% under target)
- **Total Workflow**: ~2m 51s (81% faster than 15-minute target)

### Quality Metrics Achieved
- **71 Unit Tests**: 2483 assertions, all passing
- **33 Integration Tests**: 231 assertions, all passing
- **Docker Environment**: Stable, no hanging issues
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Reliable execution, no blocking issues
- **Cross-Platform**: Windows PowerShell and Unix bash support

## Critical Issues Resolved

### Interactive Input Fixes (Critical)
**Problem**: Docker containers hanging on interactive prompts
**Solution**: 
- Added `-T` flag to prevent pseudo-TTY allocation in CI
- MySQL password: `${DB_PASS:+--password="$DB_PASS"}` syntax
- WordPress installation: Non-interactive mode enforcement

### Docker ARG Propagation Bug (Critical)
**Problem**: Multi-stage build ARG WP_VERSION losing value in Stage 4
**Solution**: Fixed line 108 from `ARG WP_VERSION` to `ARG WP_VERSION=latest`
**Impact**: Eliminated malformed SVN URLs causing build failures

### WordPress Version Compatibility (Critical)
**Problem**: Arbitrary file verification failing across WordPress versions
**Solution**: Removed hardcoded `class-wp-phpmailer.php` check (doesn't exist in all versions)
**Impact**: All WordPress versions 6.7.3+ now build successfully

### BOM Encoding Issues
**Problem**: Shell scripts with BOM causing Docker compatibility issues
**Solution**: Converted all shell scripts to Unix line endings (LF) and removed BOM
**Impact**: Cross-platform compatibility achieved

## Infrastructure Status

### Current Configuration
- **PHP Version**: 7.4 (simplified for stability)
- **WordPress Versions**: Latest (6.8.2) detected dynamically
- **Test Suite**: 104 tests running reliably
- **Execution Time**: <3 minutes (optimal performance)
- **Docker Images**: Building and deploying successfully

### Matrix Expansion Ready (When Needed)
- **Full PHP Matrix**: ['7.4', '8.0', '8.1', '8.2', '8.3', '8.4'] prepared
- **WordPress Matrix**: [latest, previous-major] detection operational
- **Performance Targets**: <15 min total, <5 min per job achievable
- **Caching Strategy**: Per-version cache scoping with mode=max

1. **Gradual Expansion**: Start with PHP 7.4 + 8.3, then add intermediate versions
2. **Performance Monitoring**: Track execution times during expansion
3. **Cost Analysis**: Monitor GitHub Actions minutes consumption
4. **Conditional Testing**: Full matrix on main branches, simplified on PRs

### Infrastructure Maintenance
1. **Quarterly Reviews**: Assess WordPress version support and PHP compatibility
2. **Performance Optimization**: Continue monitoring and optimizing build times
3. **Security Updates**: Keep Docker base images and dependencies current
