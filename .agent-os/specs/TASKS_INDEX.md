## Docker Test Optimization

### 🔄 Docker Test Optimization (Performance Enhancement)
**Location**: `.agent-os/specs/2025-08-18-docker-test-optimization/`  
**Status**: IN PROGRESS (Phase 1 Complete)  
**Priority**: HIGH - Performance Critical
**Estimated Timeline**: 4 weeks (8 phases)

**Objective**: Transform Shield Security's Docker testing from sequential execution (10+ minutes) to parallel matrix testing (under 1 minute) through evolutionary optimization.

**Phase 1 Complete** ✅:
- **Build-Once Pattern**: Plugin package built once and reused across WordPress versions
- **Version-Specific Images**: Docker images `shield-test-runner:wp-6.8.2` and `shield-test-runner:wp-6.7.3`
- **WordPress Framework Pre-Installation**: Eliminates runtime SVN checkout issues
- **Performance Foundation**: Established for Phase 2 parallel execution
- **CI Parity Maintained**: Local tests continue to match GitHub Actions exactly

#### 🎯 Performance Targets
- **Phase 1**: ✅ COMPLETED - Build separation with build-once pattern
- **Phase 2**: Parallel WordPress versions (target implementation)
- **Phase 3**: Test type splitting (target implementation)
- **Phase 4**: Base image caching (target implementation)
- **Phase 5**: PHP matrix expansion (maintain performance)
- **Phase 6**: GNU parallel integration (target implementation)
- **Phase 7**: Container pooling (target implementation)
- **Phase 8**: Enhanced reporting (maintain performance)

#### 📋 Implementation Strategy
- **Evolutionary Approach**: 8 phases, each tested and verified before proceeding
- **Single Script Evolution**: Modify `/mnt/d/Work/Dev/Repos/FernleafSystems/WP_Plugin-Shield/bin/run-docker-tests.sh` incrementally
- **Build Once, Test Many**: Plugin package built once, used across all test combinations
- **Matrix Support**: PHP 7.4, 8.0, 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4 with latest and previous WordPress versions

#### 🔧 Key Components
- **spec-lite.md**: Quick overview and constraints  
- **spec.md**: Comprehensive requirements and acceptance criteria
- **tasks.md**: Detailed phase-by-phase implementation tasks
- **sub-specs/technical-spec.md**: Exact code changes and verification steps

#### ✅ Current Task Status
- [x] Spec creation and documentation complete
- [x] Phase 1: Build separation implementation ✅ COMPLETED
- [ ] Phase 2: WordPress version parallelization (READY)
- [ ] Phase 3: Test type splitting (unit/integration)
- [ ] Phase 4: Base image caching optimization
- [ ] Phase 5: PHP version matrix expansion
- [ ] Phase 6: GNU parallel integration
- [ ] Phase 7: Container pooling implementation
- [ ] Phase 8: Result aggregation enhancement

#### 🚀 Expected Outcomes
- **10x Performance Improvement**: From 10+ minutes to under 1 minute
- **Full Matrix Support**: 6 PHP versions × 2 WordPress versions × 2 test types = 24 combinations
- **CI Parity Maintained**: Identical test results between local and GitHub Actions
- **Developer Experience**: Zero-configuration usage preserved
- **Resource Optimization**: Efficient utilization of development machine resources
