# Docker Matrix Testing - Planning and Thinking Process

## Executive Summary
This document outlines the planning and thinking process for implementing matrix testing in Shield Security's Docker infrastructure. The goal is to test across 6 PHP versions (7.4-8.4) and 2 dynamically-determined WordPress versions while optimizing for performance and cost.

## Problem Analysis

### Current State
- Single PHP version testing (8.2)
- Hardcoded WordPress version (6.4 - outdated)
- No matrix testing capabilities
- Automatic triggers on main branches

### Desired State
- Matrix testing across PHP 7.4, 8.0, 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4
- Dynamic WordPress version detection (latest + previous major)
- Optimized builds to prevent excessive CI/CD time
- Learning from established WordPress plugins

## Key Challenges and Thinking Process

### Challenge 1: WordPress Version Management
**Problem**: Need to test latest WordPress (6.7.x) and previous major (6.6.x), but only latest patch versions.

**Thinking Process**:
1. Cannot hardcode versions - WordPress releases frequently
2. Need programmatic way to determine versions
3. WordPress.org provides API endpoints
4. Must handle API failures gracefully

**Solution Approach**:
- Use WordPress.org API to fetch version information
- Parse to find latest stable and previous major
- Cache results to avoid API hammering
- Fallback to sensible defaults if API fails

### Challenge 2: Matrix Testing Scale
**Problem**: 6 PHP versions Ã— 2 WordPress versions = 12 test runs (potentially expensive and slow)

**Thinking Process**:
1. Research how successful plugins handle this
2. Look for optimization patterns
3. Consider trade-offs between coverage and speed
4. Think about when full matrix is necessary

**Research Targets**:
- WooCommerce: Largest WordPress plugin, likely has optimizations
- Yoast SEO: Performance-focused, should have efficient testing
- Easy Digital Downloads: Already uses Docker, good reference

### Challenge 3: Build Optimization
**Problem**: Docker builds could be redundant across matrix jobs

**Thinking Process**:
1. Docker layers can be cached and reused
2. Base images can be shared across PHP versions
3. Dependencies (Composer, npm) can be cached
4. GitHub Actions has built-in caching mechanisms

**Optimization Strategies to Explore**:
- Multi-stage Docker builds
- GitHub Container Registry for base images
- Dependency caching at multiple levels
- Parallel execution strategies

## Research Plan

### Phase 1: Industry Analysis
**Objective**: Learn from successful implementations

**Method**:
1. Clone repositories locally for detailed analysis
2. Study `.github/workflows/` directories
3. Look for:
   - Matrix configuration patterns
   - Caching strategies
   - Build optimization techniques
   - Version management approaches

**Expected Outcomes**:
- List of applicable patterns
- Understanding of common pitfalls
- Performance benchmarks to target

### Phase 2: Technical Feasibility
**Objective**: Validate technical approaches

**WordPress Version Detection**:
```bash
# Test API endpoints
curl -s https://api.wordpress.org/core/version-check/1.7/
curl -s https://api.wordpress.org/core/stable-check/1.0/
```

**Docker Optimization Tests**:
- Test multi-stage builds
- Measure cache effectiveness
- Benchmark different approaches

### Phase 3: Architecture Decision
**Objective**: Choose optimal implementation approach

**Decision Criteria**:
1. Performance (must complete in reasonable time)
2. Maintainability (easy to update and debug)
3. Cost (GitHub Actions minutes)
4. Reliability (consistent results)

**Options to Evaluate**:
1. **Pure GitHub Actions Matrix**
   - Pros: Native support, easy configuration
   - Cons: Potential redundancy

2. **Docker-Based Matrix**
   - Pros: More control, better caching
   - Cons: More complex

3. **Hybrid Approach**
   - Pros: Best of both worlds
   - Cons: Increased complexity

## Implementation Strategy

### Incremental Rollout
1. **Stage 1**: Add WordPress version detection
2. **Stage 2**: Add matrix for 2 PHP versions (current + one more)
3. **Stage 3**: Expand to full PHP matrix
4. **Stage 4**: Optimize based on metrics

### Testing Strategy
- Start with manual workflow triggers
- Monitor performance metrics
- Gradually enable automatic triggers
- Maintain escape hatches

## Success Metrics

### Performance Metrics
- Total workflow execution time
- Individual job execution time
- Cache hit rates
- Resource utilization

### Quality Metrics
- Test pass rates by matrix combination
- Flakiness indicators
- Failure analysis patterns

### Cost Metrics
- GitHub Actions minutes consumed
- Cost per workflow run
- ROI on optimization efforts

## Risk Analysis

### Technical Risks
1. **API Dependency**: WordPress.org API availability
2. **Complexity**: Increased maintenance burden
3. **Performance**: Longer CI/CD cycles

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Caching**: Aggressive caching at all levels
2. **Fallbacks**: Sensible defaults for all external dependencies
3. **Monitoring**: Clear metrics and alerts
4. **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides for troubleshooting

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. Begin research phase with repository analysis
2. Test WordPress API endpoints
3. Create proof-of-concept for version detection
4. Document findings progressively

### Planning Deliverables
1. Research findings document
2. Technical architecture proposal
3. Implementation timeline
4. Risk mitigation plan

## Open Questions

### Technical Questions
1. Should we test WordPress beta/RC versions?
2. How to handle PHP/WordPress incompatibilities?
3. What's the optimal cache duration?
4. Should PRs run reduced matrix?

### Strategic Questions
1. What's acceptable total execution time?
2. How much complexity is too much?
3. Should we contribute optimizations upstream?

## Conclusion
This planning process emphasizes learning from established plugins, optimizing for performance, and maintaining simplicity where possible. The incremental approach allows for course correction based on real-world performance data.
