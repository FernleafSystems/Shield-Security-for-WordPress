# Tasks - CRITICAL BUG - MATRIX TESTING BROKEN ❌

**DOCKER MATRIX TESTING STATUS**: BROKEN ❌  
**Critical Issue**: Docker ARG propagation bug preventing matrix testing from working  
**Infrastructure Status**: Docker image build fails due to WP_VERSION variable not propagating to Stage 4 of multi-stage build

## Phase 0: Critical Bug Fix - WordPress Version Hardcoding

### Immediate Fix Required
- [x] 0.1 Fix hardcoded WordPress 6.4 version in workflow
  - [x] Identify issue in docker-tests.yml workflow_dispatch default
  - [x] Remove hardcoded default to allow dynamic version usage
  - [x] Verify manual triggers use detected versions correctly
  - **Agent**: software-engineer-expert
  - **Complexity**: Simple
  - **Success Criteria**: Workflow uses latest WordPress 6.8.2 instead of 6.4
  - **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED - Fixed in workflow, manual triggers now use dynamic versions

## Phase 0.2: CRITICAL BUG - Docker ARG Propagation Failure

### Current Blocking Issue
- [ ] 0.2.1 Fix Docker multi-stage build ARG propagation bug
  - [ ] Identify root cause: ARG WP_VERSION loses value in Stage 4 of Dockerfile
  - [ ] Fix line 108 in Dockerfile from `ARG WP_VERSION` to `ARG WP_VERSION=latest`
  - [ ] Test Docker image builds successfully with proper WP_VERSION propagation
  - [ ] Verify GitHub Actions workflow passes
  - **Agent**: software-engineer-expert
  - **Complexity**: Simple but critical
  - **Success Criteria**: Docker image builds without errors, matrix testing functional
  - **Status**: ❌ NOT STARTED - Current blocker preventing all matrix testing

### Post-Fix Validation Required
After fixing the Docker ARG bug, these verification steps are mandatory:
1. **Local Docker Build**: `docker build tests/docker/` must complete successfully
2. **Local Docker Run**: Container must start and be able to run tests
3. **GitHub Actions Test**: Workflow must pass completely (not just start)
4. **Matrix Validation**: Both WordPress versions (latest/previous) must work
5. **Test Execution**: Actual PHPUnit tests must run and pass inside Docker
6. **Documentation Update**: Only then update status to show working functionality

### Bug Analysis
**Problem**: Multi-stage Docker build fails because WP_VERSION argument not propagating to Stage 4

**Root Cause**: 
- Global ARG at line 7: `ARG WP_VERSION=latest` 
- Stage-specific ARG at line 108: `ARG WP_VERSION` (without default)
- In Docker multi-stage builds, ARG re-declaration without default loses the global value
- Results in empty WP_VERSION, causing malformed SVN URLs like `tags//tests/phpunit/includes/`

**Evidence**:
- GitHub Actions Run ID: 17035308220 - FAILED with exit code 2
- Error: SVN checkout fails due to malformed URL with empty version
- Docker build process shows: `process "/bin/sh -c if [ "${WP_VERSION}" != "latest" ];` fails

**Impact**: Complete matrix testing failure - no tests can run because Docker image won't build

### Timeline of Issue Discovery
- **August 18, 2025**: Bug discovered during execute-tasks workflow
- **Previous commits**: Documentation falsely claimed "OPTIMIZATION IMPLEMENTED ✅"
- **GitHub Actions**: Run 17035308220 and earlier runs consistently failing
- **Root Cause Identified**: Docker ARG propagation failure in multi-stage build
- **Status**: Issue documented, fix identified but not yet implemented

  - Did NOT fix the actual Docker ARG propagation issue
  - Result: GitHub Actions still failed with same error
