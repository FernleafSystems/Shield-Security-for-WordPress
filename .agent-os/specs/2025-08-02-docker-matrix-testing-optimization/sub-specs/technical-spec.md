# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-02-docker-matrix-testing-optimization/spec.md

## Technical Requirements

- **Matrix Testing Scale**: 6 PHP versions (7.4, 8.0, 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4) × 2 WordPress versions = 12 test combinations
- **Dynamic WordPress Version Detection**: Real-time API integration with WordPress.org to determine latest and previous major versions
- **Performance Optimization**: Total matrix execution time < 15 minutes with individual jobs < 5 minutes
- **Build Optimization**: >50% build time reduction through multi-layer caching strategies
- **Parallel Execution**: All 12 matrix combinations run simultaneously with GitHub Actions matrix strategy
- **API Integration**: WordPress.org API (`https://api.wordpress.org/core/version-check/1.7/`) for version detection
- **Caching Architecture**: Docker layer caching, Composer dependencies, npm packages, and built assets
- **Fail-Fast Strategy**: Stop remaining matrix jobs on first failure to conserve resources
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Windows PowerShell and Unix bash script support for local matrix testing

## Architecture Details

### Matrix Configuration Strategy
```yaml
# GitHub Actions Native Matrix
strategy:
  matrix:
    php: ['7.4', '8.0', '8.1', '8.2', '8.3', '8.4']
    wordpress: ['latest', 'previous-major']
  max-parallel: 12
  fail-fast: true
```

### WordPress Version Detection Architecture
```bash
# API Integration Pattern
latest_version=$(curl -s https://api.wordpress.org/core/version-check/1.7/ | jq -r '.offers[0].version')
previous_major=$(extract_previous_major_version $latest_version)
```

### Optimization Layers
1. **Docker Layer Caching**: Multi-stage builds with shared base layers
2. **GitHub Actions Caching**: 
   - Composer dependencies (`~/.composer/cache`)
   - npm packages (`~/.npm`)
   - Built assets (`assets/dist/`)
   - Docker layers (registry caching)
3. **Registry Caching**: GitHub Container Registry for base images
4. **Conditional Execution**: Full matrix on main branches, reduced on PRs

## Implementation Specifics

### Dynamic Version Detection
- **PowerShell Script**: `bin/get-wp-versions.ps1` for version discovery
- **API Parsing**: Extract latest stable and previous major versions
- **Caching Strategy**: GitHub Actions cache with workflow duration TTL
- **Fallback Logic**: Hardcoded versions as backup if API fails
- **Current Detection**: Latest 6.8.2, Previous Major 6.7.2

### Build Optimization Techniques
```dockerfile
# Multi-Stage Docker Build
FROM php:7.4-apache as base
# Shared base layer for all PHP versions

FROM base as composer-deps
# Composer dependency layer

FROM composer-deps as npm-deps
# npm dependency layer

FROM npm-deps as final
# Final application layer
```

### Performance Optimization Strategies
- **Parallel Matrix Execution**: All 12 combinations run simultaneously
- **Build Cache Management**: Automated cache invalidation and refresh
- **Resource Allocation**: Optimal GitHub Actions runner utilization
- **Test Splitting**: Potential future enhancement for large test suites

### CI/CD Integration Enhancements
- **Workflow Triggers**: Automatic on main branches + manual dispatch
- **Environment Variables**: Dynamic PHP_VERSION and WP_VERSION injection
- **Status Reporting**: Comprehensive matrix result reporting
- **Cost Optimization**: Efficient resource usage to minimize CI/CD costs

## External Dependencies

- **WordPress.org API**: For real-time version detection and compatibility matrix
- **GitHub Container Registry**: For Docker image caching and optimization
- **GitHub Actions Matrix**: Native matrix testing capabilities
- **Docker BuildKit**: Advanced caching and build optimization features
- **jq JSON Processor**: For API response parsing in version detection scripts

**Justification**: WordPress.org API provides authoritative version information ensuring tests run against current releases. GitHub Container Registry enables efficient Docker layer caching. Matrix testing provides comprehensive compatibility validation across supported PHP versions.

## Performance Criteria
