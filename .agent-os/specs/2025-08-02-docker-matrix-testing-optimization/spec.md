## Research Requirements

### Phase 1: Industry Best Practices Analysis
Research how established WordPress plugins handle matrix testing:

#### 1.1 WooCommerce Analysis
- Repository: https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce
- Research focus:
  - Matrix testing implementation in `.github/workflows/`
  - Docker usage patterns (if any)
  - Build optimization strategies
  - WordPress version testing approach
  - Caching strategies for dependencies

#### 1.2 Yoast SEO Analysis
- Repository: https://github.com/Yoast/wordpress-seo
- Research focus:
  - PHP version matrix configuration
  - WordPress compatibility testing
  - Performance optimization techniques
  - Dependency caching patterns

#### 1.3 Easy Digital Downloads Analysis
- Repository: https://github.com/awesomemotive/easy-digital-downloads
- Research focus:
  - Docker testing patterns (they use docker-compose-phpunit.yml)
  - Matrix testing approach
  - Build time optimization

### Phase 2: WordPress Version Detection Strategy

#### 2.1 Dynamic Version Discovery
- Research WordPress.org API for version information
- Design mechanism to determine:
  - Latest stable WordPress version
  - Latest patch of previous major version
- Consider fallback strategies if API is unavailable

#### 2.2 Version Matrix Definition
- Current requirement: Test latest two major versions (latest patches only)
- Example at time of writing:
  - WordPress 6.7.2 (latest)
  - WordPress 6.6.3 (previous major, latest patch)

## Technical Design

### Matrix Configuration Strategy

#### Option 1: GitHub Actions Native Matrix
```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    php: ['7.4', '8.0', '8.1', '8.2', '8.3', '8.4']
    wordpress: ['latest', 'previous-major']
```

#### Option 2: Docker-Based Matrix
- Single Docker image with multiple PHP versions
- Environment variable-based PHP switching
- Pros: Faster builds, shared layers
- Cons: More complex Dockerfile

### Build Optimization Strategies

#### 1. Docker Layer Caching
- **Base Image Optimization**: Use multi-stage builds with shared base layers
- **Dependency Caching**: Cache Composer and npm dependencies in Docker layers
- **Registry Caching**: Push base images to GitHub Container Registry

#### 2. GitHub Actions Optimization
- **Parallel Execution**: Run matrix combinations in parallel
- **Conditional Testing**: Only run full matrix on main branches
- **Smart Caching**: 
  - Cache Docker layers between builds
  - Cache Composer dependencies
  - Cache npm dependencies
  - Cache built assets

#### 3. Test Execution Optimization
- **Test Splitting**: Divide tests across matrix jobs
- **Fail-Fast Strategy**: Stop remaining matrix jobs on first failure
- **Selective Testing**: Run minimal tests on PRs, full matrix on main branches

### WordPress Version Detection Implementation

#### API Integration
```bash
# Example: Get latest WordPress version
curl -s https://api.wordpress.org/core/version-check/1.7/ | jq -r '.offers[0].version'

# Get all versions and filter for previous major
curl -s https://api.wordpress.org/core/stable-check/1.0/ | jq -r 'to_entries | map(select(.value == "latest" or .value == "outdated")) | .[0:2]'
```

#### Workflow Integration
- Add version detection step before matrix execution
- Pass detected versions as matrix parameters
- Cache version information for workflow duration

- **Fallback**: Reduce matrix on PRs, full matrix on main branches only

### Risk 2: API Reliability
- **Mitigation**: Cache version information, implement fallbacks
- **Fallback**: Hardcoded version list updated quarterly

### Risk 3: Complexity Overhead
- **Mitigation**: Gradual implementation, thorough documentation
- **Fallback**: Maintain simple non-matrix option

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Metrics to Track
- Matrix execution time
- Cache hit rates
- Failure frequency by matrix combination
- Cost impact on GitHub Actions

### Maintenance Tasks
- Quarterly review of PHP version support
- Monitor WordPress release cycle
- Update optimization strategies based on metrics
- Keep documentation current

## Appendix: Research Notes

### WordPress Version API
- Endpoint: `https://api.wordpress.org/core/version-check/1.7/`
- Returns current stable version and download links
- Can parse for major.minor.patch information

### GitHub Actions Best Practices
- Use `actions/cache@v3` for dependency caching
- Leverage `docker/setup-buildx-action` for advanced caching
- Consider `matrix.exclude` for incompatible combinations
- Use `continue-on-error` for experimental versions

### Docker Optimization Techniques
- Multi-stage builds to share common layers
- BuildKit cache mounts for package managers
- Minimal base images (alpine where possible)
- Layer ordering optimization (least-changing first)
