# Spec Summary (Lite)

This specification outlined the enhancement of Shield Security's Docker testing infrastructure to support matrix testing across multiple PHP versions (7.4-8.4) and dynamically determined WordPress versions, with comprehensive build optimization and performance enhancements. **The implementation is now OPERATIONAL** following the resolution of critical Docker ARG propagation and WordPress version compatibility issues. The multi-stage Docker architecture, dynamic WordPress version detection, and caching strategies have been successfully implemented and tested. Matrix testing is fully functional across PHP/WordPress combinations as confirmed by GitHub Actions Run #17036484124. Phase 4 performance testing and documentation tasks remain to complete the specification.
