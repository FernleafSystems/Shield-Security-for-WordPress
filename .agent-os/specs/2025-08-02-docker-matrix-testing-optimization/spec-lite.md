# Spec Summary (Lite)

This specification outlined the enhancement of Shield Security's Docker testing infrastructure to support matrix testing across multiple PHP versions (7.4-8.4) and dynamically determined WordPress versions, with comprehensive build optimization and performance enhancements. **The implementation is BLOCKED by a critical Docker ARG propagation bug** that prevents the Docker image from building. While the multi-stage Docker architecture, dynamic WordPress version detection, and caching strategies have been designed, a critical bug in the Dockerfile (ARG WP_VERSION loses its value in Stage 4) causes all builds to fail. Matrix testing is currently non-functional and requires immediate bug fix before any testing can proceed.
