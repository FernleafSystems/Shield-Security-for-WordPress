# Shield Security - Architectural Decision Records

## ADR-001: Modular Security Architecture

**Date**: 2024-10-15  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Context**: Need for comprehensive WordPress security without feature bloat

### Problem
WordPress security requires multiple types of protection (authentication, firewall, malware detection, etc.), but most plugins focus on single areas, leading to:
- Users installing multiple security plugins with conflicts
- Inconsistent security policies across different protection layers
- Management overhead from multiple plugin interfaces
- Performance issues from redundant security checks

### Decision
Implement a modular security architecture with 8 independent but interconnected security modules that can be enabled/disabled based on specific needs:

1. Security Admin - Plugin access control
2. Firewall - Web Application Firewall
3. Login Guard - Authentication security
4. IPs - IP reputation management
5. HackGuard - File integrity and malware protection
6. Comments Filter - SPAM protection
7. Audit Trail - Activity logging
8. Traffic - Request analysis

### Rationale
- **Defense-in-Depth**: Multiple security layers provide comprehensive protection
- **Flexibility**: Users can customize security posture based on specific requirements
- **Performance**: Only enabled modules consume resources
- **Maintenance**: Modular code is easier to maintain and test
- **Compatibility**: Modules can be disabled if they conflict with specific environments

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Comprehensive security from single plugin, reduced conflicts, better performance
- **Negative**: Increased complexity in plugin architecture, larger codebase
- **Neutral**: Requires careful module interaction design

## ADR-002: Dual-Composer Architecture

**Date**: 2024-11-20  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Context**: Need for clean dependency management in WordPress plugin environment

### Problem
WordPress plugins face unique challenges with dependency management:
- Development tools shouldn't be included in production packages
- Runtime dependencies need conflict prevention (namespace collisions)
- WordPress.org plugin repository has specific requirements
- CI/CD needs different dependencies than runtime

### Decision
Implement dual-composer architecture:

**Root Level** (`composer.json`):
```json
{
  "require-dev": {
    "phpunit/phpunit": "^9.0",
    "squizlabs/php_codesniffer": "^3.6"
  }
}
```

**Library Level** (`src/lib/composer.json`):
```json
{
  "require": {
    "twig/twig": "^3.0",
    "monolog/monolog": "^2.0"
  }
}
```

### Rationale
- **Clean Separation**: Development tools separate from runtime dependencies
- **Conflict Prevention**: Runtime dependencies can be prefixed with Strauss
- **Package Size**: Production packages exclude development dependencies
- **Flexibility**: Different dependency versions for different purposes

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Clean production builds, reduced conflicts, smaller packages
- **Negative**: More complex build process, duplicate dependency management
- **Neutral**: Requires careful coordination between both composer files

## ADR-003: Strauss Prefixing Strategy

**Date**: 2024-11-25  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Context**: WordPress plugin ecosystem conflicts with shared dependencies

### Problem
WordPress plugins sharing common dependencies (Twig, Monolog, etc.) creates conflicts:
- Version mismatches between plugins using same libraries
- Fatal errors when plugins load different versions of same dependency
- WordPress.org plugin review requires conflict prevention
- Enterprise environments need guaranteed plugin compatibility

### Decision
Use Strauss v0.19.4 specifically for dependency prefixing:
- Prefix all third-party dependencies with `ICWP_WPSF_VENDOR_`
- Version lock to v0.19.4 due to file naming compatibility requirements
- Automated prefixing during build process
- Remove original dependencies after prefixing

### Rationale
- **Conflict Prevention**: Prefixed dependencies cannot conflict with other plugins
- **Version Independence**: Shield can use specific dependency versions
- **WordPress.org Compliance**: Meets plugin repository requirements
- **Reliability**: v0.19.4 creates expected file structure for Shield tests

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Zero dependency conflicts, WordPress.org compatible, reliable builds
- **Negative**: Version locked to specific Strauss version, larger file sizes
- **Neutral**: Build process complexity, dependency debugging more difficult

## ADR-004: Comprehensive Configuration System

**Date**: 2024-12-01  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Context**: Complex security plugin with hundreds of configuration options

### Problem
Shield Security requires extensive configuration to support:
- 8 different security modules with unique requirements
- Enterprise customization needs
- Granular security policy control
- Runtime configuration validation
- User interface generation from configuration

### Decision
Implement massive centralized configuration system in `plugin.json` (6,673 lines):
- All module options defined in single JSON file
- Hierarchical structure with inheritance
- Runtime validation based on JSON schema
- Dynamic UI generation from configuration
- Version-controlled configuration changes

### Rationale
- **Centralization**: Single source of truth for all configuration
- **Consistency**: Uniform option handling across all modules
- **Validation**: JSON schema enables automatic validation
- **UI Generation**: Dynamic forms reduce code duplication
- **Documentation**: Configuration serves as documentation

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Consistent configuration, reduced code duplication, automatic validation
- **Negative**: Large file size, complex parsing, potential performance impact
- **Neutral**: Learning curve for new developers, requires tooling for editing
