# Session Note: CI/CD Pipeline Rebuild Complete

**Date**: 2025-01-24  
**Task**: Fix failing CI/CD pipeline tests  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED - All tests passing

## Summary

Successfully fixed all failing PHPUnit tests in the CI/CD pipeline by addressing four key issues:

1. **Missing assets/dist directory** - Added npm build step
2. **Development files in package** - Removed src/lib/vendor/bin
3. **Strauss file naming mismatch** - Downgraded from v0.23.0 to v0.19.4
4. **Development file in vendor_prefixed** - Removed autoload-files.php

## Key Discoveries

### Strauss Version Differences
- **v0.23.0**: Creates `autoload_classmap.php` (with underscore)
- **v0.19.4**: Creates `autoload-classmap.php` (with hyphen)
- Test expects the hyphen version, so v0.19.4 is required

### Package Structure Requirements
The tests validate that the package matches production distribution:
- Must include: assets/dist, vendor_prefixed/autoload-classmap.php
- Must exclude: vendor/bin, vendor_prefixed/autoload-files.php

### Environment Variable Access
- Use `getenv()` not `$_ENV` in PHP for reliable CI access
- All working code (Yoast, Shield) uses this pattern

## Files Modified

1. `.github/workflows/minimal.yml`:
   - Added Node.js setup and npm build
   - Changed Strauss version to 0.19.4
   - Added removal of dev-only files
   - Added comprehensive debugging

2. `.claude/CI-CD.md`:
   - Updated Strauss process documentation
   - Added package validation requirements
   - Documented common pitfalls and solutions

3. `.claude/TASKS.md`:
   - Marked all milestones as completed
   - Added final resolution notes

4. `.claude/PLANNING.md`:
   - Updated status to COMPLETED
   - Added session 6 to history

## Lessons Learned

1. **Don't assume tool behavior** - Different versions create different files
2. **Test locally first** - Would have caught Strauss file naming issue
3. **Use proven patterns** - getenv() vs $_ENV was documented in working code
4. **Package tests are strict** - They validate exact production structure

## Final CI Status

- **Unit Tests**: ✅ Passing (51s)
- **Minimal Test**: ✅ Passing (11s)
- **PHPCS**: Skipped (OFF by default as designed)

The CI/CD pipeline is now fully operational with proper package-based testing.
