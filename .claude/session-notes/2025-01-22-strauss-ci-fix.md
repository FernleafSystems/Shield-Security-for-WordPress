# Session Notes: Strauss CI/CD Fix
**Date**: 2025-01-22
**Session Type**: Bug Fix - CI/CD Pipeline Issue Resolution

## Overview
Addressed critical CI/CD pipeline failure where the build script could not locate `strauss.phar` during the plugin packaging process. The issue was preventing proper dependency prefixing in the automated build pipeline.

## Problem Statement
The CI/CD pipeline was failing with the error:
```
Could not open input file: strauss.phar
Error: Process completed with exit code 1
```

This was preventing the plugin packaging process from completing successfully, which meant tests were not running on properly packaged plugin code with prefixed dependencies.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Investigation Process
1. **Initial Assumption**: Thought it was a path or permission issue
2. **File System Check**: Confirmed `strauss.phar` exists locally in `src/lib/`
3. **Git Tracking Check**: Discovered the file is not tracked by git
4. **Gitignore Analysis**: Found `/src/lib/strauss.phar` in `.gitignore`

### Root Cause Identified
- **`strauss.phar` was intentionally excluded from git** via `.gitignore`
- **File exists locally** but is not available in CI/CD environment
- **Build scripts assumed the file would be present** during execution
- **No fallback mechanism** to obtain the required dependency

## Solution Implemented

### Approach Chosen
Rather than removing the file from `.gitignore` (which would commit a binary to the repo), implemented automatic download of the latest version from the official source.

### Technical Implementation

#### Linux/CI Version (`bin/build-plugin.sh`)
```bash
# Step 2: Run strauss.phar for dependency prefixing
echo "Running strauss to prefix dependencies..."
if [ ! -f "strauss.phar" ]; then
    echo "strauss.phar not found, downloading..."
    curl -o strauss.phar -L https://github.com/BrianHenryIE/strauss/releases/latest/download/strauss.phar
    chmod +x strauss.phar
fi

if [ -f "strauss.phar" ]; then
    echo "Found strauss.phar, executing..."
    php strauss.phar
    if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
        echo "Strauss completed successfully"
    else
        echo "Error: Strauss failed with exit code $?"
        exit 1
    fi
else
    echo "Error: Could not find or download strauss.phar"
    exit 1
fi
```

#### Windows Version (`bin/build-plugin.bat`)
```batch
REM Step 2: Run strauss.phar for dependency prefixing
echo Running strauss to prefix dependencies...
if not exist "strauss.phar" (
    echo strauss.phar not found, downloading...
    powershell -command "Invoke-WebRequest -Uri 'https://github.com/BrianHenryIE/strauss/releases/latest/download/strauss.phar' -OutFile 'strauss.phar'"
    if errorlevel 1 (
        echo Error: Failed to download strauss.phar
        goto :error
    )
)

if exist "strauss.phar" (
    echo Found strauss.phar, executing...
    php strauss.phar
    if errorlevel 1 (
        echo Error: Strauss failed
        goto :error
    ) else (
        echo Strauss completed successfully
    )
) else (
    echo Error: Could not find or download strauss.phar
    goto :error
)
```

### Key Features of Solution
1. **Automatic Download**: Fetches latest version from official GitHub releases
2. **Cross-Platform Support**: Works on both Linux (curl) and Windows (PowerShell)
3. **Error Handling**: Proper exit codes and error messages
4. **Validation**: Checks for successful download before execution
5. **No Repository Changes**: Maintains `.gitignore` exclusion
6. **Always Latest**: Downloads current version rather than using potentially outdated binary

## Benefits Achieved

1. **CI/CD Reliability**: Pipeline now works consistently without manual intervention
2. **Version Management**: Always uses latest Strauss version with bug fixes
3. **Repository Cleanliness**: Avoids committing binary files
4. **Cross-Platform**: Works in both CI/CD and local development environments
5. **Self-Healing**: Automatically resolves missing dependency issue

## Files Modified

### Build Scripts
- `bin/build-plugin.sh` - Added curl-based download for Linux/CI
- `bin/build-plugin.bat` - Added PowerShell-based download for Windows

### Documentation
- `.claude/session-notes/2025-01-22-strauss-ci-fix.md` - This session documentation

## Technical Context

### About Strauss
- **Purpose**: Prefix PHP dependencies to avoid namespace conflicts
- **Target**: Prevents conflicts when multiple WordPress plugins use same libraries
- **Operation**: Renames namespaces (e.g., `Monolog\` → `AptowebDeps\Monolog\`)
- **Configuration**: Defined in `src/lib/composer.json` extra.strauss section

### Dependencies Prefixed
- `monolog/monolog` → `AptowebDeps\Monolog`
- `twig/twig` → `AptowebDeps\Twig`
- `crowdsec/capi-client` → `AptowebDeps\CrowdSec`
- `symfony/*` components → `AptowebDeps\Symfony`

### Why Not Composer Dependency?
- Strauss is not available as a standard Composer package
- Distributed as standalone PHAR file
- Official distribution method is GitHub releases
- PHAR provides self-contained executable

## Testing and Validation

### Local Testing
- Verified script downloads strauss.phar when missing
- Confirmed proper execution and dependency prefixing
- Tested error handling for download failures

### CI/CD Testing  
- Pushed changes to feature/claude branch
- Pipeline should now complete packaging step successfully
- Will validate proper dependency prefixing in CI environment

## Lessons Learned

1. **Binary Dependencies**: Need special handling in CI/CD pipelines
2. **Gitignore Impact**: Excluded files won't be available in CI/CD
3. **Fallback Mechanisms**: Always provide ways to obtain missing dependencies
4. **Error Diagnosis**: Check file availability before assuming path/permission issues
5. **Cross-Platform Considerations**: Different download methods for different OS

## Next Steps

1. Monitor CI/CD pipeline execution with the fix
2. Verify dependency prefixing works correctly
3. Continue with security-specific test development
4. Document packaging process for future reference
