# Session Notes: CI/CD Fixes and Deployment
**Date**: 2025-01-22
**Session Type**: CI/CD Pipeline Maintenance and Fixes

## Overview
This session focused on deploying the CI/CD enhancements created in previous sessions and fixing issues that arose during the initial deployment. Successfully resolved PHPStan configuration issues and simplified the test matrix to focus on PHP 7.4 with WordPress latest.

## Tasks Completed

### 1. Reviewed Project Documentation
- Examined global CLAUDE.md for PHP coding standards
- Reviewed project-specific CLAUDE.md for Shield Security context
- Checked plan tracker to understand current progress (Step 7: Deploy and monitor CI/CD)

### 2. Deployed CI/CD Enhancements
- **Commit**: a2484c188 - "Add comprehensive test infrastructure with CI/CD pipeline"
- Pushed enhanced CI/CD workflow with full WordPress integration
- Includes Docker Compose setup and custom WordPress test scripts
- Updated plan tracker to reflect deployment completion

### 3. Simplified Test Matrix
- **Commit**: 97625d6ae - "Limit CI/CD to PHP 7.4 with WordPress latest for initial testing"
- Modified both ci.yml and ci-enhanced.yml workflows
- Reduced test matrix from multiple PHP versions (7.4-8.3) to only PHP 7.4
- Kept WordPress testing to latest version only
- Commented out full matrix for easy re-enabling later
- Updated all PHP version references in quality checks

### 4. Fixed PHPStan Autoload Error
- **Commit**: 0e074a5e5 - "Fix PHPStan error by installing src/lib dependencies in CI"
- Discovered plugin has separate composer.json in src/lib directory
- Added composer install steps for src/lib in all CI jobs:
  - Quality check job
  - Test job
  - Security scan job
  - Both ci.yml and ci-enhanced.yml workflows
- Fixed "Failed opening required" error for plugin_autoload.php

### 5. Fixed PHPStan Configuration Issues
- **Commit**: 35991cd43 - "Fix PHPStan configuration and WordPress class loading"
- Addressed deprecated configuration warnings:
  - Replaced `checkMissingIterableValueType` with proper ignoreErrors identifier
  - Replaced `checkGenericClassInNonGenericObjectType` with proper ignoreErrors identifier
- Fixed WordPress class loading:
  - Added PHPStan WordPress extension include
  - Created dedicated phpstan-bootstrap.php file
  - Resolved "Class 'WP_REST_Controller' not found" error

## Files Modified

### Workflows
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Added src/lib composer install, limited to PHP 7.4
- `.github/workflows/ci-enhanced.yml` - Added src/lib composer install, updated PHP versions

### Configuration
- `phpstan.neon` - Updated configuration, added WordPress extension, fixed deprecated options
- `phpstan-bootstrap.php` - New file for PHPStan bootstrapping without WordPress loading

### Documentation
- `.claude/plan-tracker.md` - Updated to reflect Step 7 completion and current progress

## Key Discoveries

1. **Dual Composer Structure**: The plugin has two composer.json files:
   - Root composer.json for development dependencies
   - src/lib/composer.json for plugin runtime dependencies
   - CI must install both sets of dependencies

2. **PHPStan WordPress Integration**: 
   - Plugin already had szepeviktor/phpstan-wordpress in dependencies
   - Just needed to include the extension in phpstan.neon
   - Custom bootstrap file prevents WordPress loading conflicts

3. **Test Matrix Simplification**:
   - Starting with single PHP version makes debugging easier
   - Can gradually expand matrix once tests are stable
   - Kept configuration for easy re-enabling

## Next Steps

1. Monitor GitHub Actions for successful CI/CD execution
2. Address any remaining test failures
3. Once stable, consider re-enabling multi-version testing
4. Begin work on Step 8: Create security-specific tests

## Lessons Learned

- Always check for multiple composer.json files in complex plugins
- PHPStan bootstrap should be minimal to avoid loading conflicts
- Start with simplified test matrix when establishing CI/CD
- Deprecated configuration warnings should be addressed promptly

## Session Result
âœ… Successfully deployed CI/CD enhancements and fixed all immediate issues. Pipeline should now run cleanly with PHP 7.4 and WordPress latest.
