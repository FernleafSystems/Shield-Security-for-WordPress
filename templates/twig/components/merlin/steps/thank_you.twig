	<p>Thank you for taking the time to go through the Guided Setup Wizard.</p>
	<p>By default, Shield is automatically configured to protect your site from numerous threats
	   and block bad visitors and bots without you having to do anything.</p>

	<p class="mt-3">Here are some of the ways Shield is already protecting your site:</p>
	<ul class="list-group list-group-flush">
		<li class="list-group-item">Powerful <strong>Firewall</strong> is intercepting and blocking malicious traffic.</li>
		<li class="list-group-item">Always <strong>watching for bots</strong> and maintaining a reputation score for each visitor.</li>
		<li class="list-group-item"><strong>Scanning</strong> your core WordPress files and directories for changes and new files.</li>
		<li class="list-group-item">Automatically <strong>blocking</strong> malicious visitors by IP (so you don't have to maintain an IP list yourself).</li>
		<li class="list-group-item">Protecting against the #1 source of <strong>Comment SPAM</strong>.</li>
		<li class="list-group-item">Keeping a log of <em>everything</em> significant in your <strong>Activity Log</strong>.</li>
		<li class="list-group-item">Protecting your <strong>important user forms</strong> such as Login, Registration and Lost Password.</li>
	</ul>
