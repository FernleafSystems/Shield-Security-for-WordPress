<h3>Become A Pro Supporter</h3>
<p>It is our commitment to continue to offer the core security features of Shield for <strong>absolutely
	free</strong> wherever possible.
<p>If you want technical support, import/export of options, extra features and all the other bells and whistles,
   you can go Pro for $1/month - you won't find a Pro plugin for better value than that.
   Anywhere.</p>
<p>Again, don't worry if you don't want the extras, your site will still be secured.</p>
<p>But if you'd like to lend your support for future development and get all the perks, click here
   to grab a license.</p>
