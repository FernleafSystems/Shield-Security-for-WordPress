	<h3>Unrecognised File Scanner - File Exclusions</h3>
	<p>Every website is different, so there are often many different types of files present on web hosts
	that are perfectly legitimate.</p>
	<p>Since we can't account for all these possibilities, we provide you with the option
	   to add your own list of excluded files, that the scanner will then ignore.</p>
	<p>In the box provided below, simply add each file name you want to ignore. If you
	don't know what to put in here just now, or you don't want to add any further exclusions, simply move
	to the next step to run the scanner.</p>
	<p>Note: You can easily come back to this step and add files if the scanner picks anything up
	that you then want to ignore. You can do this as often as you like.</p>
	<p>Please use the list of files below to tell the file scanner which files it should completely ignore:</p>
	<form class="form-horizontal icwp-wizard-form" id>
		<input name="wizard-step" value="exclusions" type="hidden" />

		<div class="form-group">
			<label class="col-md-4 control-label" for="email">Excluded Files List</label>
			<div class="col-md-8">
				<textarea class="form-control" name="exclusions" rows="{{ data.files.count + 2 }}"
						  placeholder="{{ data.files.list }}">{{ data.files.list }}</textarea>
				<span id="helpBlock" class="help-block">
					Take a <strong>new line</strong> for each file name.
					<br/>Note: You may also use regular expressions - if you don't know what this is,
					that's no problem, then please use normal file names and ignore the following guidance.
					<br/>Regular expressions must <strong>start and end</strong> with a "hash" character
					i.e. <code>#</code>
					<br />For example: <code>#.log#</code>
					<br />This will match the following files:
					<code>test.log</code>, <code>text.log.txt</code>, <code>.log.ini</code>
				</span>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="form-group">
			<div class="col-md-offset-4 col-md-8">
				<button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary">Update File Exclusions</button>
			</div>
		</div>
	</form>

	<script type="text/javascript">
		jQuery( document ).on( 'icwpWizardFormSubmit', function ( event, bSuccess ) {
			if ( bSuccess ) {
				var $oForm = jQuery( event.target );
				jQuery( 'button[type=submit]', $oForm ).prop( 'disabled', false );
			}
		} );
	</script>
