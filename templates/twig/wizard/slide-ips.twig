<h3>Automatic IP Blacklist</h3>
<p>Many security plugins offer the option of blacklisting IP addresses.</p>
<p>But the big secret they're not telling you is that this is complete waste of your time.</p>
<p>Can you think of anything you'd rather be doing, than getting 100s of email notifications and then
   having to go in and add IP addresses to some blacklist?</p>
<p>We all have friends and family we'd rather be seeing, important work to be done, and bills to pay.
   Life is waaay too short to be manually blocking IPs on every site we manage.</p>
<p>That's why we built our <strong>F</strong>ully <strong>A</strong>utomatic <strong>B</strong>lack
   <strong>L</strong>ist <strong>E</strong>ngine (FABLE).</p>
<p>FABLE will track naughty behaviour, and if the same visitor/bot does one-too-many naughty things,
   we block that IP. Simples. But not permanently, because that would make our IP list explode, and slow
   down our website like it's running Wordfence. ;)</p>
<p>And nobody wants that. So FABLE keeps your IP blacklist nice and lean.</p>

<p>By default, nefarious visitors are blocked for 1 minute, after 10 naughty requests (aka 'transgressions').</p>
<p>You can change these settings in the IP Manager, but for now, let's just turn it on. Also,
if you turned on the Audit Trail in the previous step, you can use this to monitor IP blacklisting.</p>
