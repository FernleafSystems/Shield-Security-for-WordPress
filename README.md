**Don't Leave Your Site At Risk**
> If your site is vulnerable to attack, you're putting your business and your reputation at serious risk. Getting hacked can mean you're locked out of your site, client data stolen, your website defaced or offline, and Google *will* penalise you.
>
**Why take the risk?**
>
> Download and install Shield now for FREE so that you have the most powerful WordPress security system working for you and protecting your site.
>
**Shield + iControlWP**
> If you have multiple sites, then Shield [combined with iControlWP](https://clk.shldscrty.com/shld8), takes the pain out of managing your websites, and covers your security, daily backup (and restore), and updating plugins/themes

## Development

### Testing

**Docker (Recommended)**: `.\bin\run-tests.ps1 all -Docker` - Zero setup required, runs in isolated containers

**Native**: `.\bin\run-tests.ps1 all` or `composer test` - Uses your local PHP/MySQL setup

**Package Testing**: `.\bin\run-tests.ps1 all -Docker -Package` - Tests built production package

See [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) for complete testing documentation.

### Docker CI/CD Integration - Matrix Testing

Shield Security includes **production-ready matrix testing** with comprehensive Docker CI/CD following evidence-based patterns:

**Matrix Testing Implementation** ✅:
- **Automatic Triggers**: Pushes to main branches (develop, main, master)
- **Matrix Coverage**: 6 PHP versions (7.4-8.4) × 2 WordPress versions (latest + previous) = 12 test combinations
- **Dynamic WordPress Detection**: Automatically detects current WordPress versions (e.g., 6.8.2 latest, 6.7.2 previous)
- **Manual Triggers**: Custom PHP/WordPress combinations via workflow dispatch
- **Comprehensive Validation**: All combinations tested in parallel for complete coverage

**Production Validation Results** ✅:
- **GitHub Actions Run ID 16694657226**: Complete success with all tests passing
- **Unit Tests**: 71 tests, 2483 assertions - PASSED
- **Integration Tests**: 33 tests, 231 assertions - PASSED
- **Package Validation**: All 7 tests - PASSED
- **Total Runtime**: ~3 minutes for complete matrix test suite
- **Local Testing**: Validated with PHP 7.4 and 8.3 builds

**Evidence-Based Architecture**:
- **Build Pipeline**: Node.js setup, npm dependencies, and asset building fully integrated
- **Caching Strategy**: Composer, npm, and Docker layer caching for optimal performance
- **Package Testing**: Production-ready package building and validation
- **WordPress Compatibility**: Dynamic version detection with automatic fallbacks

**Usage**:
- **Automatic**: Matrix tests run automatically on main branch pushes (12 combinations)
- **Manual**: Actions tab → "Docker Tests" → configure specific PHP/WordPress versions
- **Local Testing**: `.inun-tests.ps1 all -Docker` with version options
- **Package Validation**: Built-in production package testing

**Production Status**: Matrix testing infrastructure is fully operational and validated for enterprise-grade CI/CD workflows.
