**Don't Leave Your Site At Risk**
> If your site is vulnerable to attack, you're putting your business and your reputation at serious risk. Getting hacked can mean you're locked out of your site, client data stolen, your website defaced or offline, and Google *will* penalise you.

**Why take the risk?**
>
> Download and install Shield now for FREE so that you have the most powerful WordPress security system working for you and protecting your site.
>
**Shield + iControlWP**
> If you have multiple sites, then Shield [combined with iControlWP](https://clk.shldscrty.com/shld8), takes the pain out of managing your websites, and covers your security, daily backup (and restore), and updating plugins/themes
