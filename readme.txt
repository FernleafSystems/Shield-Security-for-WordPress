== Description ==

## Key Security Features At A Glance

### *silent*CAPTCHA Bad Bot Protection

Bad bots are you're #1 security threat. They account for nearly all WordPress security probes, attacks, injections, malware and vulnerability exploitation.

Google reCAPTCHA and CloudFlare Turnstile are considered the best way to detect bots, but these along with all other CAPTCHAs interrupt the user experience.

Shield's exclusive *silent*CAPTCHA detects bad bots and blocks them from taking any abusive actions on your site, such as brute-force user login attacks and WP Comments SPAM.

Furthermore, privacy directives from legislation such as Europe's GDPR restrict what data you may share of your visitors. All *silent*CAPTCHA data is kept on your WordPress site and ensures full compliance with GDPR regulations.

### Comprehensive Activity Log

Shield's has best-in-class logging that documents every WP action on your site.

Unlike existing logging solutions, Shield detects changes to your WordPress sites that happen directly on your database. e.g. by hackers that have infiltrated your defenses via an exposed vulnerability.

No other WordPress security plugin does this.

### Limit Login Attempts and Block User Registration SPAM

*silent*CAPTCHA technology is invisible to your visitors and protects your WordPress login, registration and lost password forms from brute force attacks, and eliminates user registration SPAM from bots.

### User Session Theft Protection

Shield can lock user session to browsers, or IP addresses. Combine with 2FA (below), you can protect your users from session theft and account theft.

### Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) for all users

Two-Factor Authentication is a crucial part of WordPress user security. It protects against account theft, takeover, and sharing. Shield supports email-based login code, Google/Microsoft/Lastpass Authenticator, Yubikey One-Time Passwords and Passkeys (pro).

### Exclusive Security Admin Protection

Not only does Shield Security protect your WordPress site, it also provides security against tampering of key WordPress options and the Shield Security plugin itself. With Shield's exclusive Security Admin feature, you can lockdown the security plugin from other admins to prevent accidental or malicious changes that will impact your security.

### CrowdSec Partnership

Shield is the only WordPress security plugin with strategic partnerships that bring powerful protection to your WordPress sites. With our CrowdSec integration, your WordPress sites benefit from crowd-sourced IP Block Lists so your site can block malicious bots before they can do any damage whatsoever.

#### [Full Shield Security Features List](https://clk.shldscrty.com/shieldfeatures)

Shield is the only security plugin for WordPress that prioritises protection and intrusion prevention before repair. With Shield Security, your site will immediately to block visitors as they probe your site looking for vulnerabilities, and before they can do damage.

**No other standalone WordPress security plugin** (including [Wordfence](https://clk.shldscrty.com/shieldvswordfence), WP Cerber, Ninja Firewall, All-In-One Security) approaches security in this way. The 1st step in any good security system is Intrusion Detection/Prevention, the 2nd step is repair. Shield Security does both.

#### Get the highest rated 5* Security Plugin for WordPress

Per download, Shield Security [has the highest 5* rating](https://clk.shldscrty.com/jl) in the WordPress plugin repository.

## Leave Behind the Security Marketing Hype and Scare Mongering

Our solution isn't designed to scare you and make you feel unsafe.

### 2 Key WordPress Security Strategies

Shield Security uses 2 simple key strategies to protect your WordPress sites:

1. Intrusion Prevention System - Detect Bots/Malicious IPs that will try to hack and invade your WordPress sites.
1. Block & Recover - Block Bad Bots and Repair Hacks

#### Key Security Strategy #1: Hacking Prevention

Bad Bots are the primary cause for nearly all our security troubles - they're relentless, automatic and powerful.

Shield Security is highly focused on their detection and eradication from your WordPress sites.

Blocking malicious bots before they do damage through malware and exploitation of vulnerabilities is the #1 security strategy to protect and enhance security on a WordPress site.

Shield detects these malicious visitors, then blocks their access to your site completely. This involves analysing different security bot-signals and combining them to identify a visitor as malicious.

These security signals include:

* site probes that generate 404 errors
* failed logins
* logins with invalid usernames
* xml-rpc access
* fake search engine web crawlers
* invalid user agents
* excessive website requests and resource abuse
* and many more signals our security team have identified.

Early identification and blocking of malicious bots reduces your WordPress site's vulnerability to any sort of attack.

#### Key Strategy #2: Hacking Recovery

Even with the best security efforts, a site can get hacked. This usually involves file modification: either a hack file is added, or a file is changed.

There are 3 key WordPress assets whose files can be hacked:

1. WordPress Core
1. WordPress Plugins
1. WordPress Themes

Almost every security plugin can now do #1 - it's easy because WordPress.org provides *checksums* for core files.

But, there are no hashes available for plugins and themes, particularly premium plugins, so they can't do it.

Shield is **the only WordPress security plugin** that offers accurate detection of file modifications for all plugins and themes because we **build our own file fingerprints**.

Shield can compare the file contents of every plugin & theme in the WordPress.org repository, looking for changed or new files

And, if you're a ShieldPRO client, you can protect premium plugins/themes too, including Yoast SEO and Advanced Custom Fields Pro.

Where possible, Shield will repair any unrecognised/modified files it detects.

#### Non-stop Security Notifications Are Not Okay.
Your security plugin must be smarter, and take responsibility for decisions, so you don't have to.

Shield handles many problems for you, making intelligent decisions without noisy email notifications.

### Dedicated Premium Support When You Go PRO

The Shield Security team prioritises email technical support over the WordPress.org forums.
Individual, dedicated technical support is only available to customers who have [purchased Shield Pro](https://clk.shldscrty.com/ab).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Please see the dedicated security [help centre](https://clk.shldscrty.com/firewallhelp) for details on features and some FAQs.

= How does the Shield Security compare with other WordPress Security Plugins? =

Easy - we're just better! ;)

Firstly, we don't modify any core WordPress or web hosting file. This is important and explains why randomly you upgrade your security plugin and your site dies.

Ideally you shouldn't use this alongside other Anti-SPAM plugins or security plugins. If there is a feature you need, please feel free to suggest it in the support forums.

= My server has a security firewall, why do I need this plugin? =

This plugin is an application layer firewall, not a server/network security firewall.  It is designed to interpret web calls to your site to look for attempts to circumvent it and gain unauthorized access.

Your network security firewall is designed to restrict access to your server based on certain types of network traffic.  The Shield Security plugin is designed to restrict access to your site, based on certain types of web calls.

= How does the IP Security Bypass List work? =

Any IP address that is on the whitelist will not be subject to **any of the firewall security processing**.  This setting takes priority over all other settings.

= Does the IP Bypass support IP ranges? =

Yes. To specify a range you use CIDR notation.  E.g. ABC.DEF.GHJ.KMP/16

= I want to review and manage IP addresses, where can I do that? =

You can use IP Rules section. This is an essential tool you can use to analyse IP address, review information concerning blocked and bypassed IP addresses.

It shows you geo-location information and all the request made to your site by that IP, including offenses and any logged-in users.

= I've locked myself out from my own site! =

This happens when any the following 3 conditions are met:

*	you have added your IP address to the firewall blacklist,
*	you have enabled 2 factor authentication and email doesn't work on your site (and you haven't chosen the override option)

You can completely turn OFF (and ON) the Shield Security by creating a special file in the plugin folder.

Here's how:

1.	Open up an FTP connection to your site, browse to the plugin folder <your site WordPress root>/wp-content/plugins/wp-simple-firewall/
1.	Create a new file in here called: "forceOff".
1.	Load any page on your WordPress site.
1.	After this, you'll find your Shield has been switched off.

Remember: If you leave one of these files on the server, it will override your on/off settings, so you should delete it when you no longer need it.

= Which takes precedence... bypass list or block list? =

Bypass List: so if you have the same address in both lists, it'll be bypassed and never be blocked.

= Can I assist with development? =

Yes! We actively [develop our plugin on Github](https://github.com/FernleafSystems/wp-simple-firewall) and the best thing you can do is submit pull request and bug reports which we'll review.

= How does the pages/parameters whitelist work? =

It is a comma-separated list of pages and parameters. A NEW LINE should be taken for each new page name and its associated parameters.

The first entry on each line (before the first comma) is the page name. The rest of the items on the line are the parameters.

The following are some simple security examples to illustrate:

**edit.php, featured**

On the edit.php page, the parameter with the name 'featured' will be ignored.

**admin.php, url, param01, password**

Any parameters that are passed to the page ending in 'admin.php' with the names 'url', 'param01' and 'password' will
be excluded from the firewall processing.

*, url, param, password

Putting a star first means that these exclusions apply to all pages.  So for every page that is accessed, all the parameters
that are url, param and password will be ignored by the firewall.

= How does the login cooldown security feature work? =

Login Cooldown Security prevents more than 1 login attempt to your site every "so-many" seconds.  So if you enable a login cooldown of 60 seconds, only 1 login attempt will be processed every 60 seconds.  If you login incorrectly, you wont be able to attempt another login for a further 60 seconds.

This security system completely blocks any level of brute-force login attacks and a cooldown of just 1 second goes a long way to adding security to your WordPress login.

[More Info](https://clk.shldscrty.com/2t)

= How does the GASP Login Guard work? =

This is best [described on the blog](https://clk.shldscrty.com/2u)

= How does the 2-factor authentication security work? =

2-Factor Authentication [is best described here](https://clk.shldscrty.com/2v).

= I'm not receiving the email with 2FA verification code.? =

Email delivery is a huge problem with WordPress sites and is very common.

Your WordPress is not designed to send emails. The best solution is to use a service that is dedicated to the purpose of sending emails.

[This is what we recommend](https://clk.shldscrty.com/jj).

= I'm getting an update message although I have auto update enabled? =

The Automatic (Background) WordPress updates happens on a WordPress schedule - it doesn't happen immediately when an update is detected.
You can either manually upgrade, or WordPress will handle it in due course.

= I'm getting large volumes of comment SPAM. How can I stop this? =

You can use Shield Security to block 100% of automated spam bots and also block and analyse human spam. [This is best described here](https://clk.shldscrty.com/jg).

= Do you offer White Label? =

Yes, we do. You can essentially rename the Shield Security plugin to whatever you would like it to be.

It ensures a more consistent brand offering and presents your business offering as a more holistic, integrated solution.

We go into [further detail here](https://clk.shldscrty.com/jh).

= I’d like to customise 2FA emails sent to my site users. How can I do that? =

You can use our custom [templates for this purpose](https://clk.shldscrty.com/ji).

= How can I change the text/html in the Plugin Security Badge? =

Use the following filter and return the HTML/Text you wish to display:

`add_filter( 'icwp_shield_plugin_badge_text', 'your_function_to_return_text' );`

= How can I change the roles for login notification security emails? =

Use the following filter and return the role in the function:

`add_filter( 'icwp-wpsf-login-notification-email-role', 'your_function_to_return_role' );`

Possible options are: network_admin, administrator, editor, author, contributor, subscriber

= What changes go into each Shield Security release? =

The changelog outlines the main changes for each release. We group changes by minor release "Series". Changes in smaller "point" releases are highlighted
 using **(.1)** notation.  So for example, version 10.1**.1** will have changelog items appended with **(.1)**

You can view the entire [Shield changelog here](https://clk.shldscrty.com/shieldwporgfullchangelog).
